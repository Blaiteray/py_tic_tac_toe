No setup step required. If you are in windows just, open `t3.exe` in the `win/dist` folder to play. If you are in debian based linux os, open `t3` from `deb/dist`.


*Note that the AI for this game is not perfect, it won't win/draw always. It was made this way to make this boring game a bit more interesting*
